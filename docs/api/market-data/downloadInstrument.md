# Download Instruments (GZ) API

The **Download Instruments API** allows you to retrieve the *entire master list* of tradable instruments across all exchanges in one single request. 

Because this list is massive (containing hundreds of thousands of instruments), the response is compressed into a `.gz` (GZIP) file.

!!! tip "Best Practice: Fetch Once Daily"
    You should only call this endpoint **once per day** (ideally early in the morning before market open).

## Endpoint

## How to Download and Extract

The downloaded file is a compressed GZIP file containing a massive JSON array. If you try to open the raw response directly as text, it will look like gibberish. You must decompress it first.

Here are a few ways to download and read the file programmatically:

=== "cURL (Command Line)"

    To download the file directly to your computer using your terminal:

    ```bash
    curl -X 'GET' \
      'http://uat.quantxpress.com/v1/api/instruments/gz/download' \
      --output instruments.json.gz
    ```
    *After downloading, you can extract it using terminal commands like `gunzip instruments.json.gz` or using GUI extraction tools like WinRAR or 7-Zip.*

=== "Python"

    This script downloads the file, unzips it in memory, and parses the JSON seamlessly without needing to save it to your hard drive.

    ```python
    import requests
    import gzip
    import io
    import json

    url = "http://uat.quantxpress.com/v1/api/instruments/gz/download"

    response = requests.get(url)

    if response.status_code == 200:
        # Decompress directly from bytes
        compressed_data = io.BytesIO(response.content)
        with gzip.open(compressed_data, 'rt') as f:
            data = json.load(f)
            
        print(f"Successfully loaded {len(data)} instruments!")
        print("First instrument:", data[0])
    else:
        print(f"Failed: {response.status_code} - {response.text}")
    ```

## Understanding the Response

Once decompressed, the file will contain a JSON array of objects. Below are sample objects representing different types of instruments.
